# 🚀 Welcome to Dropio

**Dropio** is a modern, developer-friendly file upload and delivery platform built to handle everything from simple file transfers to advanced multi-part uploads with real-time progress tracking.

This documentation will guide you through the process of integrating Dropio into your project—from setup to customization.

## 🎯 What is Dropio?

Dropio helps you:

- 📦 Upload files easily via a simple frontend or API
- ☁️ Store files using local or object storage like S3
- 🔒 Protect uploads with token-based authentication
- 📡 Track upload progress via WebSocket
- 🔄 Manage submitted files and metadata
- ⚙️ Integrate seamlessly into your existing frontend/backend stack

It's especially useful for developers building:

- SaaS platforms that require file upload functionality
- Content submission systems (e.g., osu! mapping tools, forms)
- Internal tools or dashboards with media support
- Developer tools and utilities requiring temporary or persistent file storage
