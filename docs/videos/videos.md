## Dropio Setup From Zero (NextJs App Router)

This guide walks through the complete process of setting up the **Dropio** platform from scratch. It starts by setting up a Next.js project, installing dependencies, configuring environment variables, and then moves on to setting up and testing **Dropio** itself.

Each step is presented clearly without any voice narration or background music, making it ideal for those who prefer a clean, distraction-free visual reference. The entire setup is completed in under 5 minutes, providing a quick and efficient way to get Dropio up and runningâ€”whether for development, testing, or deployment purposes.
